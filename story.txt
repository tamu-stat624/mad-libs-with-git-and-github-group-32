Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear John,

I am writing to you from a insane spaceship in a Loudly galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a maroon rocket in September. There are 22 cats and dogs of book here! In the
A&M there is a pool full of gold. I fall asleep each night on a huge bed of
Feathers and dream of dancing happily. It feels as though I have lived here for
7 minutes. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
jogging on a joyful Cyber Truck!!


Best wishes,
Harsh
